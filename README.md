# Studio Edwin

**Based on [London After Midnight](https://github.com/vaporwavy/gatsby-london-after-midnight) for Gatsby** which is based on [London](https://github.com/ImedAdel/gatsby-london) for Gatsby.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new project

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    gatsby new my-awesome-portfolio https://github.com/jooplaan/gatsby-london-night-and-day
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-awesome-portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
